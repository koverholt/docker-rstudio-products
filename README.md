# RStudio products docker stacks

Docker images for RStudio Professional Products

**IMPORTANT:** There are a few things you need to know before using these images:
1. These images are provided as a convenience to RStudio customers and are not formally supported by RStudio. If you have questions about these images, you can ask them in the issues in the repository or to your support representative, who will route them appropriately.
1. Outdated images will be removed periodically from DockerHub as product version updates are made.  Please make plans to update at times or use your own build of the images.
1. These images are meant as a starting point for your needs. Consider creating a fork of this repo, where you can continue to merge in changes we make while having your own security scanning, base OS in use, or other custom changes.  We provide [instructions for building](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-docker-products#instructions-for-building) for these cases.

# RStudio Server Pro

#### Simple Example

To verify basic functionality as a first step:

```
# Replace with valid license
export RSP_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data using default configuration
docker run --privileged -it \
    -p 8787:8787 \
    -e RSP_LICENSE=$RSP_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-server-pro:latest
```

Open http://localhost:8787 to access RStudio Server Pro. The default username and password are rstudio.

For a more "real" deployment, continue reading!

#### Overview

Note that running the RStudio Server Pro Docker image requires the container to run using the `--privileged` flag and a
valid RStudio Server Pro license.

This container includes:

1. R 3.6.1
2. Python 3.6.5
3. RStudio Server Pro

#### Configuration

The configuration of RStudio Server Pro is made on a set of file in the `/etc/rstudio` directory. Mount this directory as
volume with the host machine to change the configuration and restart the container for changes to take effect.

Be sure the config files have:

- `launcher.conf` and enable Local Launcher
- `rserver.conf` to connect to the Local Launcher
- `jupyter.conf` with `jupyter-exe` pointing to the Jupyter executable in the Docker image

See a complete example of that file at `server-pro/conf`.

#### Persistent Data

In order to persist RSP user files between container restarts please mount `/home` with a persistent volume in the host
machine or your docker orchestration system.

#### Licensing

Using the RStudio Server Pro Docker image requires to have a valid License. You can set the RSP license to use this in
one three ways:

1. Setting the `RSP_LICENSE` environment variable to a valid license key
2. Setting the `RSP_LICENSE_SERVER` environment variable to a valid license server / port
3. Mounting a `/etc/rstudio-server/license.lic` single file that contains a valid license for RStudio Server Pro

**NOTE:** the "offline activation process" is not supported by this image today. Offline installations will need
to explore using a license server, license file, or custom image with manual intervention.

#### Users

By default the container will create a test user, that user can be controlled by the environment
variables: `RSP_TESTUSER`, `RSP_TESTUSER_PASSWD`, `RSP_TESTUSER_UID`.

In order to use this container with a different user structure such as LDAP you need to extend the container to use a
valid PAM configuration. See
the [RStudio Server Pro guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/authenticating-users.html) for more information.

#### Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|-----|---|---|
| `RSP_TESTUSER` | Test user to be created in the container, turn off with an empty value | `rstudio` |
| `RSP_TESTUSER_PASSWD` | Test user password | `rstudio` |
| `RSP_TESTUSER_UID` | Test user UID | `10000` |
| `RSP_LICENSE` | License key for RStudio Server Pro, format should be: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` | None |
| `RSP_LICENSE_SERVER` | Floating license server, format should be: `my.url.com:port` | None |
| `RSP_LAUNCHER` | Whether or not to use launcher locally / start the launcher process | true |
| `RSP_LAUNCHER_TIMEOUT` | The timeout, in seconds, to wait for launcher to startup before proceeding | 10 |

#### Ports

| Variable | Description |
|-----|---|
| `8787` | Default HTTP Port for RStudio Connect |
| `5559` | Port for RStudio Launcher server |

#### Example usage:

```bash
# Replace with valid license
export RSP_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data and using an external configuration
docker run --privileged -it \
    -p 8787:8787 -p 5559:5559 \
    -v $PWD/server-pro/conf/:/etc/rstudio \
    -e RSP_LICENSE=$RSP_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-server-pro:latest

# Run with persistent data and using an external configuration
docker run --privileged -it \
    -p 8787:8787 -p 5559:5559 \
    -v $PWD/data/rsp:/home \
    -v $PWD/server-pro/conf/:/etc/rstudio \
    -e RSP_LICENSE=$RSP_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-server-pro:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) to access RStudio Server Pro.
The default username and password are `rstudio`.

# RStudio Connect

#### Simple Example

To verify basic functionality as a first step:

```
# Replace with valid license
export RSC_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data and using default configuration
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -e RSC_LICENSE=$RSC_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3939](http://localhost:3939) to access RStudio Connect.

For a more "real" deployment, continue reading!

#### Overview

This Docker container is built following
the [RStudio Connect admin guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/index.html), please
see [Server Guide/Docker](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/server-management/#docker) for more details on the
requirements and how to extend this image.

This container includes:

1. R 3.6.1
2. Python 3.6.5
3. RStudio Connect

Note that running the RStudio Connect Docker image requires the container to run using the `--privileged` flag and a
valid RStudio Connect license.

> IMPORTANT: to use RStudio Connect with more than one user, you will need to
> define `Server.Address` in the `rstudio-connect.gcfg` file. To do so, update
> your configuration file with the URL that users will use to visit Connect.
> Then start or restart the container.

#### Configuration

The configuration of RStudio Connect is made on the `/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg` file, mount this file as
volume with an external file on the host machine to change the configuration and restart the container for changes to
take effect.

Be sure the config file has this fields:

- `Server.Address` set to the exact URL that users will use to visit Connect. A
  placeholder `http://localhost:3939` is in use by default
- `Server.DataDir` set to `/data/`
- `HTTP.Listen`
- `Python.Enabled` and `Python.Executable`

See a complete example of that file at `connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg`.

#### Persistent Data

In order to persist RSC metadata and app data between container restarts configure RSC `Server.DataDir` option
to `/data` and share the `/data` directory with a persistent volume in the host machine or your docker orchestration
system.

# RStudio Package Manager

#### Simple Example

To verify basic functionality as a first step:

```bash
# Replace with valid license
export RSPM_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

# Run without persistent data and using default configuration
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 4242:4242 \
    -e RSPM_LICENSE=$RSPM_LICENSE \
    rstudio/rstudio-package-manager:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) to access RStudio Package Manager UI.

For a more "real" deployment, continue reading!

#### Overview

Note that running the RStudio Package Manager Docker image requires the container to run using the `--privileged` flag
and a valid RStudio Package Manager license.

This container includes:

1. R 3.6.1
3. RStudio Package Manager

#### Configuration

The configuration of RStudio Package Manager is made on the `/etc/rstudio-pm/rstudio-pm.gcfg` file, mount this file as
volume with an external file on the host machine to change the configuration and restart the container for changes to
take effect.

Be sure the config file has this fields:

- `Server.DataDir` set to `/data/`
- `HTTP.Listen`

See a complete example of that file at `pacakge-manager/rstudio-connect.gcfg`.

#### Persistent Data

In order to persist RSPM package data data between container restarts configure RSPM `Server.DataDir` option to `/data`
and share the `/data` directory
with a persistent volume in the host machine or your docker orchestration system.

#### Licensing

Using the RStudio Package Manager docker image requires to have a valid License. You can set the RSC license in three ways:

1. Setting the `RSPM_LICENSE` environment variable to a valid license key
2. Setting the `RSPM_LICENSE_SERVER` environment variable to a valid license server / port
3. Mounting a `/etc/rstudio-pm/license.lic` single file that contains a valid license for RStudio Package Manager

    rstudio/rstudio-package-manager:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:4242](http://localhost:4242) to access RStudio Package Manager UI.

To create repositories you need to access the container directly and execute some commands.
To do this find the container ID for RSPM (using `docker ps`) and run:

```
docker exec -it {container-id} /bin/bash
```

Then please refer to the [RSPM guide](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/) on how
to [create and manage](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/getting-started/configuration/) your repositories. For
example to serve CRAN:

```
# Initiate a sync:
rspm sync --wait

# Create a repository:
rspm create repo --name=prod-cran --description='Access CRAN packages'

# Subscribe the repository to the cran source:
rspm subscribe --repo=prod-cran --source=cran
```

# RStudio Team

We provide a `docker-compose.yml` that could help to spin up default configurations for RStudio Team (all RStudio
products together).

If you are using this locally you need to setup some hostnames to point to `localhost` in order for some integrations to
work fine in your browser. In your `/etc/hosts` add one line:

```
127.0.0.1 rstudio-server-pro rstudio-connect rstudio-pm
```

```bash
# Replace this with valid licenses
export RSP_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
export RSC_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
export RSPM_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

docker-compose up
```

## Privileged Containers

Notice that each example above uses the `--privileged` flag. Each RStudio
Professional product uses the `--privileged` flag for user and code isolation
and security. Each product differs in the exact reasons why, but we would love
to hear from you if this is concerning in your infrastructure. See [RStudio Professional Product Root & Privileged Requirements](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005369282) for more information.

If you have feedback on any of our professional products, please always feel
free to reach out [on RStudio
Community](https://community.rstudio.com/c/r-admin), to your Customer Success
representative, or to sales@rstudio.com.

# Floating license server

**WARNING**: Floating Licenses should not be used within docker containers in a
production context, since the docker container failing could require manual
intervention to fix (see the app below). We provide these images only for
development and testing.

If you want to test floating licenses locally. You will need to do the following:

- Request a floating license key (these are different from normal license keys)
- Ensure that the floating license key works within a hypervisor (by default, they do not)

Then run:

```bash
# Replace this with valid licenses
export RSP_FLOAT_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
export RSC_FLOAT_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
export RSPM_FLOAT_LICENSE=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

make run-floating-lic-server
```

This will build and run 3 containers that are accessible in the `rstudio-docker-products` network at these hostnames:

- RStudio Server Pro: `rsp-float-lic:8989`
- RStudio Connect: `rsc-float-lic:8999`
- RStudio Package Manager: `rspm-float-lic:8969`

After on a new terminal that you can run any product docker containers, for example:

```bash
export RSP_LICENSE_SERVER=rsp-float-lic:8989
export RSC_LICENSE_SERVER=rsc-float-lic:8999
export RSPM_LICENSE_SERVER=rspm-float-lic:8969

# RStudio Server Pro
docker run --privileged -it \
    -p 8787:8787 -p 5559:5559 \
    -v $PWD/data/rsp:/home \
    -v $PWD/server-pro/conf/:/etc/rstudio \
    -e RSP_LICENSE_SERVER=$RSP_LICENSE_SERVER \
    --network rstudio-docker-products \
    rstudio/rstudio-server-pro:1.2.5033-1

# RStudio Connect
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 3939:3939 \
    -v $PWD/data/rsc:/data \
    -v $PWD/connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg:/etc/rstudio-connect/rstudio-connect.gcfg \
    -e RSC_LICENSE_SERVER=$RSC_LICENSE_SERVER \
    --network rstudio-docker-products \
    rstudio/rstudio-connect:1.8.0.3-19

# RStudio Package Manager
docker run -it --privileged \
    -p 4242:4242 \
    -v $PWD/data/rspm:/data \
    -v $PWD/package-manager/rstudio-pm-float.gcfg:/etc/rstudio-pm/rstudio-pm.gcfg \
    -e RSPM_LICENSE_SERVER=$RSPM_LICENSE_SERVER \
    --network rstudio-docker-products \
    rstudio/rstudio-package-manager:latest
```

**Note:** You need to configure the products (config files) to use remote license, please look at the corresponding admin guides.

- [RStudio Server Pro](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/license-management.html#floating-licensing)
- [RStudio Connect](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/licensing/#floating-licenses)
- [RStudio Package Manager](https://docs.rstudio.com/rspm/admin/licensing/#licensing-floating)

If you run into trouble with your license, this app may be helpful to deactivate all instances of the license:

# Instructions for building

After you have cloned [rstudio-docker-products](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-docker-products), you can create your own containers fairly simply with the provided Makefile.

To build RStudio Server Pro:
```
make server-pro
```
To build RStudio Connect:
```
make connect
```
To build RStudio Package Manager:
```
make package-manager
```

You can alter what exactly is built by changing `server-pro/Dockerfile`, `connect/Dockerfile`, and `package-manager/Dockerfile`.

You can then run what you've built to test out with the `run-` commands.  For instance, to run the server-pro container you've built:
```
make run-server-pro
```

Note you must have a license in place, and all of the other instructions in separate sections above are still relevant.

If you have created an image you want to use yourself, you can push to your own image repository system.  The images are named `rstudio-server-pro`, `rstudio-connect`, and `rstudio-package-manager`.
