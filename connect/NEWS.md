# 2022-01-23

- Add documentation for license leak bug and possible workarounds/solutions.
- Add an option in the `Justfile` to persist license state files for use
across multiple restarts.

# 2022-12-05

- Add `libnss-sss` and `libpam-sss` to work more nicely with `sssd` as a client
  (if needed)

# 2022-07-11

- Switch container default configuration to use the `Logging` configuration
  section. [See the docs](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/logging/) for
  more info

# 2022-04-07

- The Dockerfile now uses BuildKit features and must be built with
  DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1.

# 2021.10.0

- Add a bunch of system dependencies. This makes the image build bigger (~4GB),
  but ensures that R and Python content / packages are much more likely to
  build and run without error

# 2021.08.0

- WARNING: this Dockerfile now only works with `YYYY.MM.PATCH` (this is because
  directories used to be structured in three parts like `1.9.0` and are now in
  two like `2021.08`)

# 1.9.0.1

- BREAKING: change how python is installed, some of the PATH definitions, etc.
  - also bump python version from 3.6.5 to 3.8.10 and 3.9.5 (for consistency with other products)
- Add R 4.1.0 to the Connect image

# 1.8.8.2

- Add NEWS.md
